1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

  React JS is a UI library, that allows us to create large scale applications.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
  
  React makes you think about building your app beforehand. It's best to sketch your app and know your components beforehand.
  
3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

  Class components are a part of ES6 and allow us to manage our state within our component. Functional Components are just functions that render JSX and accept props as arguments.

4.  Describe state.
  
  State is and object that contains our data for our app. When state is changed our render method is called only updating what is changed.

5.  Describe props.

  We pass state to other components using props. It is essentially our data.
